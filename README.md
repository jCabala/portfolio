# Personal portfolio website

This is my personal portfolio website. 

I decided to make it with pure html and css with addition of bootstrap.

I wnated to show that I have proficient skills in these languages and I don't realy only on advance js frameworks. 

Some of the photos are frome https://www.manypixels.co/ which is, in my opinion, a grat website offering good-looking and free cartoon-like images. 

To make waves dividing sections, I used https://getwaves.io
